The OnAssignment Drupal Portal is the new way for applicants to step through the on-boarding process for open assignments in an easy, self-service fashion. Through extensive web service integration with OnAssignment's recruiting platform (RecruitMax) and their new Oracle WebContent Content repository, document workflows between applicant, recruiter, and QA resource have been greatly streamlined compared to legacy processes.

On-boarding requirements for applicants depend on the requirements of the assignment being applied for. Up to 17 Drupal forms are exposed in 3 phases to capture personal information from the applicant, depending on the requirements of their position, and collect information required for employer forms, government forms, and to satisfy other regulatory concerns. All documents created and captured are stored in OnAssignment's document repository for versioning, indexing, searching, and retention. The Drupal Portal reacts in real-time to the changing status of documents stored in the repository, and other changes made to their applicant record.

Resonance Development was responsible for the Drupal module development and web service architecture for this project.
