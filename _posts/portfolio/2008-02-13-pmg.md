PMG required an enterprise-grade CMS to replace their 10-year-old, in-house legacy system. The legacy content amounted to 10,000 documents and 6,400 users, all of which were imported into the new Drupal site. The site has since grown to 14,000 nodes and 13,000 users.

The site leverages an Apache Solr search server hosted by Resonance Development.
