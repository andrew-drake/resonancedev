Resonance Development has partnered with Holland College and the Holland College Hurricanes Booster Club to coordinate and develop a web site for the Holland College Hurricanes Football Club.

<!--break-->

The purpose of this site is to provide a more dedicated web presence for the promotion and support of the Club, less encumbered by the restrictions placed upon existing web presences at HollandCollege.com and Facebook. As the officially promoted and populated web site of the Club, this site will provide the Booster Club with both the online resources to conduct membership and fundraising activities with greater ease and reach, and the web traffic to capture a targeted market for those activities.

Key features

100% Responsive Design. iPhone & iPad ready.
Real-time scoreboard leveraging Node.JS
Payment Gateway integration for Membership and Sponsorship credit card transactions
Powerful CMS capabilities via Django CMS
