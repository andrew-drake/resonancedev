A team of 5 developers, led by Ryan Palmer of Resonance Development, was called upon to salvage a Drupal 5->6 migration project that was in jeopardy of failing in January 2011. Two previous teams had failed to produce production-quality code over the span of 6 months, and thus a significant refactoring exercise was undertaken to bring the project up to a high standard. The upgraded site launched successfully in April of 2011.
